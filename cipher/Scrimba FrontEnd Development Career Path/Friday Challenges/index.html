        <p>What's the secret to learning to code?</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, it's by coding!</p>
        <p>So this weekend, I'm going to continue my code-at-least-a-bit-everyday habit. Hence my inaugural Friday
            Challenge!</p>
        <p>And this one the perfect practice for me. I've tried centering lists before and have yet to get it exactly as
            I
            envisioned.</p>
        <p>How do I accomplish this and keep myself mellow at the same time?</p>
